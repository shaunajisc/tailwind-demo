This task is designed for the Prospects team, focusing on applying and experimenting with Tailwind CSS following the Intro to Tailwind session.

Objective: Utilise the concepts learned during the Intro to Tailwind session to create a card using Tailwind CSS. While exact dimensions are flexible, aim to capture the essence of the card's design. Creativity in styling is encouraged.

## Screenshots of the card

2. Style the card to resemble the provided examples. Feel free to interpret the design in your own way.

3. Implement responsive design: Adjust the card's width from 'max-w-sm' to 'max-w-md' at the 'md' breakpoint for larger screens.

4. Add a hover style to the hashtags at the bottom, so the background colour is `cypress-blue` (this is a custom colour that has already been added to the theme, you can see this in the [tailwind config](https://github.com/shaunajisc/tailwind-demo/blob/main/tailwind.config.js) ) and the text colour is `gray-100` when the user hovers over a tag 




## Hints 
- Use 'text-base' and 'gray-700' for the description text.
- The header should be styled using 'text-bold' and 'text-xl'.
- Hashtags are styled with 'font-semibold'.
- Tailwind comes with built in, custom drop shadows that you can read more about [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow).
